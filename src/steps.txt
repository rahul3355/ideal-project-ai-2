1. Set up React (npx create-react-app ideal-project-ai)
2. Install Axios (npm install axios)
3. Create .env file for environment variables
4. Create 'components' directory inside src
5. In App.js:
    a. Import modules and components
    b. Initialize state with useState
    c. Defining the 'generateProjectIdea' function
    d. Rendering the component (UI)
    e. Export the component (export default App;)

    Error: Error as the './component/ProjectForm' file was not exporting anything, but we were importing it in the App.js.
    Solution: Render a basic component in ProjectForm and export the component.

6. In ProjectForm.js:
    a. Import modules
    b. Define ProjectForm component
    c. Handling Input changes
    d. Handling Form Submission
    e. Building the form
    f. Export the component


Errors: AxiosError, BadRequest 401
Solution: Recheck if API KEY is correct (console log it)
Restart the development server (CTRL+C, then npm start)
Don't confuse '' with ``, ${} can only be used with `` (key above the Tab key on keyboard)
Don't forget to remove the console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY) in production

Happy coding :)
